Just as in a forest, where every species is a fundamental piece of the puzzle, every story, data point, and human connection plays a vital role in building a sustainable future. My work exists at the intersection of these elements. With a foundation in Environmental Science and Terrestrial Ecology, I bring scientific rigor to every project. My passion lies in translating that complex reality—from the intricacies of biodiversity to the urgency of climate change—into narratives that are not only understandable but emotionally resonant. Whether it's through a 30-second reel, a deep-dive podcast, or a detailed infographic, my goal is to foster the awareness and collective action our planet needs."
